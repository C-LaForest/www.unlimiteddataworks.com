        <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a visionary technology leader with over 25 years of experience driving enterprise-wide transformation in mission-critical, 
            highly regulated environments—with specialized expertise in medical research IT infrastructure, clinical systems, 
            and translational research data management.</p>
        <p>My unique strength lies in bridging the gap between cutting-edge research objectives and the robust, 
            compliant technology infrastructure needed to achieve them. Having collaborated directly with research 
            physicians, I understand the intricate challenges facing Principal Investigators (PI)s running grant-funded studies in rare diseases 
            like lipodystrophy, T2 diabetes research, and complex translational medicine initiatives.</p>
        <p>I excel at transforming fragmented data environments into integrated, analysis-ready platforms that accelerate discovery while 
            maintaining the highest standards of regulatory compliance and data integrity. 
            My approach ensures that technology becomes an enabler of groundbreaking research rather than a barrier to scientific progress.</p>
