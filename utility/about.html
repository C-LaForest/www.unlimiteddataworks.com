      <h2>Leadership Philosophy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lead with Technical Credibility and Integrity:</strong> I believe in leading by example, drawing on hands-on experience across every major IT and OT discipline in utilities. This credibility fosters trust, open communication, and a culture where every team member’s expertise is valued.</li>
        <li><strong>Champion Safety, Compliance, and Risk Reduction:</strong> My leadership is grounded in a safety-first mindset and a relentless focus on regulatory compliance (NERC CIP, PHMSA). I ensure that every decision is defensible, risk-aware, and aligned with the highest standards of operational integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Empower Teams Through Ownership and Mentorship:</strong> I build high-performing, cross-functional teams by empowering members with ownership, continuity, and opportunities for professional growth. I mentor teams to foster innovation, knowledge sharing, and resilience in high-stakes environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Drive Strategic Alignment and Transformational Outcomes:</strong> I translate complex technical concepts into actionable business strategies, bridging the gap between technical teams and executive leadership to deliver measurable results—such as 99.99%+ system uptime and 100% audit pass rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Transparent, Data-Driven Decision-Making:</strong> My approach is rooted in transparency and data. I synthesize complex information, anticipate outcomes, and communicate decisions clearly to all stakeholders, ensuring buy-in and confidence at every level.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Vendor Neutrality and Ethical Leadership:</strong> I prioritize organizational and regulatory interests over vendor preferences, ensuring that all technology decisions are made with integrity and in the best interest of the utility.</li>
        <li><strong>Foster a Culture of Continuous Improvement:</strong> I encourage teams to embrace change, learn from challenges, and pursue ongoing improvement—ensuring that modernization efforts enhance both safety and operational excellence.</li>
